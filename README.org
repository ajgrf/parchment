* Parchment

Parchment is an editor theme for Vim and Emacs, inspired by Acme and
Leuven.  You might like it if you prefer light colorschemes but think
black-on-white is too hard on your eyes, or if you find most
colorschemes too busy.

** Installation

*** Emacs

**** MELPA

After [[https://melpa.org/#/getting-started][enabling installation]] of MELPA
packages, install =parchment-theme= with ~M-x package-install~. Load
it using ~load-theme~.

Or if you are using =use-package= (strongly recommended), simply add the
following to your =init.el=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package parchment-theme
    :ensure t
    :config (load-theme 'parchment t))
#+END_SRC

**** Manual

To install =parchment-theme= for Emacs manually instead, first clone the
repository to your local system:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  mkdir -p ~/.emacs.d/themes
  git clone https://github.com/ajgrf/parchment ~/.emacs.d/themes/parchment
#+END_SRC

Then add the following to your =init.el= or =.emacs= file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes")
  (load-theme 'parchment t)
#+END_SRC

*** Vim

Parchment can be installed in the same way as most other vim plugins and
colorschemes.  If you don't have a preferred method of installing vim plugins,
I recommend using [[https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen][pathogen]] to install parchment.  Once pathogen is set up,
just clone this repo into your bundle directory:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git clone https://github.com/ajgrf/parchment ~/.vim/bundle/parchment
#+END_SRC

** Terminal Colors

If your terminal does not support true colors, you will need to use a matching
terminal theme, and ensure that it does not use bright colors for bold text.
The following X resources accomplish that for xterm and urxvt:

#+BEGIN_SRC conf-xdefaults
  *background:           #ffffea
  *foreground:           #000000

  *color0:               #000000
  *color1:               #880000
  *color2:               #005500
  *color3:               #663311
  *color4:               #004488
  *color5:               #770077
  *color6:               #007777
  *color7:               #eeeecc
  *color8:               #eaeaea
  *color9:               #ffeaea
  *color10:              #eaffea
  *color11:              #eeee9e
  *color12:              #cceeff
  *color13:              #ffeaff
  *color14:              #eaffff
  *color15:              #ffffea
